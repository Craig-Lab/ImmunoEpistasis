# ImmunoEpistasis
Code to run the model described in Craig, Deng, and McLeod.

Install ddesd_f5 using the installation files provided or change the call to ddesd_f5 to ddesd (in the model code); ddesd is included in native Matlab. ddesd_f5 cannot be run on Matlab past r2022a.

Run either of the commands files (single or double mutant) to execute the code. Each calls their respective run file which calls the single or double mutant model code. 
Both commands files will run for healthy and immunodeficient hosts.
