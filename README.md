# ImmunoEpistasis
Code to run the model described in Craig, Deng, and McLeod.

You must install ddesd_f5 (or change the command to call ddesd which is included with Matlab) to run this code. ddesd_f5 cannot be run on Matlab past r2022a.

Run either of the commands files (single or double mutant) to execute the code. Each calls their respective run file which calls the single or double mutant model code. 
Both commands files will run for healthy and immunodeficient hosts.
