Save both files to any folder.

run the installMyDdesd script in matlab. (On a windows PC you'll
likely need to be running matlab in Administrator mode).

After the install ddesd_f5 should run like other de codes.

Do NOT keep a spare copy of ddesd_f5.m in any folder in which you
want to run the code, as this will prevent matlab finding the
installed copy.
